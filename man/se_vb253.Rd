\description{
RNA was harvested from lung fibroblasts serum starved for 24 h prior to
treatment with TGFβ (2 ng/mL) in combination with MCT4 inhibitor VB253 (10
μM). DMSO (0.1\%) was the vehicle control. After 48 h of treatment, RNA was
extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit and submitted for sequencing by
Innomics. The samples were analyzed using their DNBSEQ platform with 150 bp
paired-end sequencing with greater than 20 M clean reads per sample. All
samples passed quality control and mapping checks. Reads were aligned to
transcript sequences from GENCODE release 47 using \code{salmon}. Processing
details are outlined in the \code{data-raw} folder of the package source. The
cleaned sequences are available from the NIH short read archive (SRA) as
project number PRJNA1011992.
