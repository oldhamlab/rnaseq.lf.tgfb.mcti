Description: This package is a data repository for RNA-seq data obtained to 
    study the impact of lactate transport inhibition on myofibroblast 
    differentiation. Normal lung fibroblasts (Lonza) were treated with TGFβ 
    (2 ng/mL) in combination with MCT1 inhibitor AZD3965 (100 nM) or MCT4 
    inhibitor VB124 (10 μM), separately or together, with DMSO (0.1%) as the 
    vehicle control. RNA was obtained after 48 h of treatment and submitted for 
    sequencing.
