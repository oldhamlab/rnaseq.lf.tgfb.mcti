#' Summarized RNA-seq Data
#'
#' RNA was harvested from lung fibroblasts were serum starved for 24 h prior to
#' treatment with TGFβ (2 ng/mL) in combination with MCT1 inhibitor AZD3965
#' (100 nM), MCT4 inhibitor VB124 (10 μM), or both. DMSO (0.1%) was the vehicle
#' control. After 48 h of treatment, RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy kit
#' and submitted for sequencing by BGI Genomics. The samples were analyzed using
#' their DNBSEQ platform with 100 bp paired-end sequencing with greater than 20
#' M clean reads per sample. All samples passed quality control and mapping
#' checks. Reads were aligned to transcript sequences from GENCODE release 44
#' `salmon`. Processing details are outlined in the `data-raw` folder of the
#' package source. The cleaned sequences are available from the NIH short read
#' archive (SRA) as project number ###.
